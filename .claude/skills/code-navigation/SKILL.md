# Code Navigation Skill

## When to Use

- Exploring an unfamiliar codebase or module
- Tracing a function call across multiple files
- Understanding blast radius before a breaking change
- Planning edits that touch multiple files

## When NOT to Use

- Simple single-file edits where you already know the location
- Reading config or documentation files

## Core Principle

> Collapse multiple tool calls into fewer, smarter ones. Every unnecessary read or search wastes tokens and turns.

## Choose The Right Navigation Tool

- Use `srcwalk_read`, `srcwalk_deps`, `grep`, `csearch` for file reading, blast-radius checks, pattern search, and multi-keyword chunk search
- Use `srcwalk_callers`, `srcwalk_callees`, `srcwalk_flow`, `srcwalk_impact`, `srcwalk_map` for call graphs, orientation slices, impact triage, and repo maps — these are first-class Pi tools, no separate skill load needed
- All tools are backed by the installed `srcwalk` binary via the `srcwalk.ts` extension

## Navigation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Search First, Read Second

**Wrong** (3-6 tool calls):
```
glob("*.ts") → read(file1) → "too big" → grep("functionName") → read(file2) → read(file3, section)
```

**Right** (1-2 tool calls):
```
grep("functionName", path: "src/") → read(exact_file, offset: line-10, limit: 30)
```

Start with `grep` or `csearch` to locate, then read only what you need.

### Pattern 2: Multi-Symbol Search

When tracing a call chain (A calls B calls C), search for all symbols together:
```
grep({ pattern: "functionA|functionB|functionC", path: "src/" })
```

Or use `srcwalk_callers` for structural caller detection, or `srcwalk_flow` for a combined callers+callees+resolves slice.

### Pattern 3: Don't Re-Read What You've Already Seen

**Anti-pattern**: Search returns full function body, then agent reads the same file again.

If search results already show the code you need, work from that output. Only re-read when:
- You need surrounding context (lines above/below the match)
- You need the exact content for editing (verify before edit)
- The search result was truncated

### Pattern 4: Blast Radius Check (Before Breaking Changes)

**WHEN**: Before renaming, removing, or changing the signature of an export.
**SKIP**: When adding new code, fixing internal bugs, or reading.

Steps:
1. `srcwalk_deps(path: "src/file.ts")` — find importers and downstream users
2. `srcwalk_callers({ symbol: "symbolName", scope: "src" })` — find call sites with optional depth/filter
3. Review each caller to assess impact
4. Plan edits from leaf callers inward (furthest dependencies first)

### Pattern 5: Context Locality

When editing a file, search results from the same directory/package are more likely relevant. Use `path` to scope grep results:
- `grep({ pattern: "...", path: "src/same-module/" })`

### Pattern 6: Outline Before Deep Read

For large files (>200 lines), get the structure first:
```
srcwalk_read(path: "src/large-file.ts")
```

This gives you structure and line ranges. Then read only the section you need.

### Pattern 7: Follow the Call Chain (Not the File Tree)

**Wrong**: Read files top-to-bottom hoping to understand the flow.
**Right**: Start from the entry point, follow function calls:

```
1. `grep({ pattern: "entryPoint" })` → find where it is defined
2. `srcwalk_callees({ symbol: "entryPoint", scope: "src" })` or `srcwalk_flow` for call graph orientation
3. `srcwalk_read(section: "line-range")` → drill into the interesting callee
```

## With Srcwalk Backend

All navigation tools are native srcwalk_* tools. Available tools:

| Task | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pattern search | `grep` | Exact/regex symbol search, multi-pattern, scoped |
| Multi-keyword chunk search | `csearch` | Find code by multiple keywords, returns ranked function/class chunks |
| Find files by glob | `glob` | Built-in glob file discovery |
| Large file read | `srcwalk_read` | Auto-outlines, shows structure |
| Direct callers | `srcwalk_callers` | Structural call-site evidence |
| Transitive callers | `srcwalk_callers(depth: N)` | Multi-hop BFS up to 5 |
| Forward call graph | `srcwalk_callees(detailed: true)` | Ordered sites with arg slots |
| Function orientation | `srcwalk_flow` | Callers + callees + resolves |
| Import + dependents | `srcwalk_deps` | File-scoped import evidence + heuristic |
| Heuristic triage | `srcwalk_impact` | Follow up with callers for proof |
| Repo shape | `srcwalk_map` | Token budgets + directory skeleton |

**IMPORTANT**: Use `grep` for exact-pattern searches, `csearch` for multi-keyword chunk discovery, and `srcwalk_*` tools for structural navigation (call graphs, deps, file reads).

## Cost Awareness

Every tool call has a token cost. Efficient navigation means:
- Fewer tool calls per task
- Less context consumed by redundant reads
- More budget available for actual implementation

**Target**: Find and understand any symbol in ≤3 tool calls, not 6+.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---|---|
| Read entire large file | Use outline first, then section read |
| Search → read same code again | Work from search results directly |
| Trace calls one-by-one | `srcwalk_callers` / `srcwalk_callees` or multi-pattern `grep` |
| Explore randomly | Start from entry point, follow calls |
| Forget to check blast radius | Always check before signature changes |
